GreatLittleWebsite-WP-theme
===========================

A parent and child theme base with Bootstrap &amp; more for pastable, quick templating.

This is not meant to be a professional-level theme or anything. It's just a version of a quick framework, and I'll be refining it over time to make it more flexible and fast for getting designs into Wordpress.

I like to be able to copy and paste and work directly with each project, so that's the idea of this (for now).

----
<h3>To Do...</h3>
<ol>
<li>Incorporate various Bootstrap templates neatly as functions or page templates (still pastable)</li>
<li>Add HTML5 elements, microdata</li>
<li>Improve SASS by adding more default classes/common mixins, clean up SASS in glwparent</li>
</ol>
----

<h2>What's included?</h2>
<ul>
<li>SASS (<a href="http://leafo.net/scssphp/">SCSSPHP</a>) (or just CSS if you want)</li>
<li>Bootstrap (with <a href="https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker">Navwalker</a> for tiered menus)</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce">WooCommerce</a> support</li>
</ul>

<p>A note on SASS. I'm not really THAT into being a CSS or SASS nerd - I just use it to style things, thanks. Since this template is including Bootstrap by default, obviously a lot of styling is already handled.</p>
<p>A larger empty SASS project folder with some setup (from a Treehouse tutorial) is built in just in case. But mostly I am only changing fonts, a few colors, and some basic positioning and spacing. So the SCSS I have set up reflects those needs.</p>
<p>My basic SASS includes some default styles and common classes I use.</p>

<h2>What's Coming Soon?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML5, microformats</li>
<li>More Bootstrap features</li>
</ul>
