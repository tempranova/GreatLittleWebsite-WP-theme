GreatLittleWebsite-WP-theme
===========================

A parent and child theme base with Bootstrap &amp; more for pastable, quick templating.

This is not meant to be a professional-level theme or anything. It's just a version of a quick framework, and I'll be refining it over time to make it more flexible and fast for getting designs into Wordpress.

I like to be able to copy and paste and work directly with each project, so that's the idea of this (for now).

<h3>To Do...</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add HTML5 elements, microdata</li>
<li>Clean up Bootstrap templates with dynamic code, HTML5, clean samples, proper paths</li>
<li>Incorporate templates as includes</li>
<li>Add back-end selection for uploading logo and doing some basic color additions, then also for selecting which Bootstrap templates to use, which categories to use with them, incorporating as page templates, and more</li>
<li>Improve SASS by adding more default classes/common mixins, clean up SASS in glwparent</li>
</ol>

<h2>What's included?</h2>
<ul>
<li>SASS (<a href="http://leafo.net/scssphp/">SCSSPHP</a>) (or just CSS if you want)</li>
<li>Bootstrap (with <a href="https://github.com/twittem/wp-bootstrap-navwalker">Navwalker</a> for tiered menus)</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce">WooCommerce</a> support</li>
</ul>

<p>A note on SASS. I'm not really THAT into being a CSS or SASS nerd - I just use it to style things, thanks. Since this template is including Bootstrap by default, obviously a lot of styling is already handled.</p>
<p>A larger empty SASS project folder with some setup (from a Treehouse tutorial) is built in just in case. But mostly I am only changing fonts, a few colors, and some basic positioning and spacing. So the SCSS I have set up reflects those needs.</p>
<p>My basic SASS includes some default styles and common classes I use.</p>

<h2>What's Coming Soon?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML5, microformats</li>
<li>More Bootstrap features</li>
</ul>
