===========================

A parent and child theme base with Bootstrap &amp; more for pastable, quick templating.

This is not meant to be a professional-level theme or anything. It's just a version of a quick framework, and I'll be refining it over time to make it more flexible and fast for getting designs into Wordpress.

I like to be able to copy and paste and work directly with each project, so that's the idea of this (for now).

----
<h3>To Do...</h3>
<ol>
<li>Set up SASS properly and modularly, get rid of default code</li>
<li>Incorporate various Bootstrap templates neatly as functions or page templates (still pastable)</li>
<li>Add HTML5 elements, microdata</li>
</ol>
----

<h2>What's included?</h2>
<ul>
<li>SASS (SCSSPHP)</li>
<li>Bootstrap (with Navwalker)</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's Coming Soon?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML5, microformats</li>
<li>More Bootstrap features</li>
</ul>
